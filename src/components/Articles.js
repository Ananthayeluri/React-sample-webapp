     author:"Bob Ziroll",
     content:"Many modern websites are actually made up of a single page, they just look like multiple pages because they contain components which render like separate pages.

    author:"Tyler McGinnis",
    content:"Since React v0.14.0, we’ve had two ways to create components - classes or functions. The difference was that if our component had state or needed to utilize a lifecycle method, we had to use a class. Otherwise, if it just accepted props and rendered some UI, we could use a function.",
